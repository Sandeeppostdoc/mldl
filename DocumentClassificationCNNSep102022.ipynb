which case could read any mail encrypted you and sign messages with your private key rsa generally believed resistant all standard cryptanalytic techniques even standard key long enough render this impractical barring huge investment hardware breakthrough factoring breaking des would allow attacker read any given message since the message itself encrypted with des would not allow attacker claim you des has only bits its key and thus could conceivably compromised brute force with sufficient hardware but few agencies have such money devote simply read one message since each message has different des key the work for each message would remain high key management attacks stealing your private key would allow the same benefits breaking rsa safeguard encrypted with des key which derived from passphrase you type however attacker can get copy your private keyfile and your passphrase could break the whole scheme the main risk that transferring either the passphrase the private key file across untrusted link not that trusted machine preferably one sitting right front you ideally your own machine your own home which nobody else has physical access fooling you into accepting bogus public key for someone else could allow opponent deceive you into sending secret messages him rather than the real recipient the enemy can fool your intended recipient well could encrypt the messages with the other bogus public key and pass them along important get the proper public keys other people the most common mechanism for this finger assuming the opponent has not compromised routers daemons such finger can given fair amount trust the strongest method key authentication exchange keys person however this not always practical having other people vouch for you signing statement containing your key possible although does not have features for doing this automatically pgp does generate and check fingerprints public keys the key files they may exchanged via separate channel for authentication playback attacks even opponent cannot break the cryptography opponent could still cause difficulties for example suppose you send message with mic only alice which says let that your opponent intercepts and now resends who now has message which authenticated from you telling him that course may interpret entirely different context your opponent could transmit the same message the same recipient much later figuring would seen differently later time the opponent could change the originator himself register your public key his and send message hoping the recipient will send him return mail indicating the unknown message defeat playback attacks the plaintext each message should include some indication the sender and recipient and unique identifier good front end script for should this automatically recipient you should sure that the originator header and the sender indicated within the plaintext are the same that you really are recipient and that the message not old one some this also can and should automated the author this faq has made modest attempt automating the process generating and checking encapsulated headers the programs are included the standard distribution the utils directory local attacks clearly the security cannot greater than the security the machine where the encryption performed for example under unix super user could manage get your encrypted mail although would take some planning and effort something like replace the executable with trojan horse get copy the plaintext depending how stored addition the link between you and the machine running extension that you decrypt with remote machine which you are connected via network eavesdropper could see the plaintext should only executed systems you trust obviously the extreme case should only used your own machine which you have total control over and which nobody else has access which has only carefully examined software known free viruses and however there very real trade off between convenience and security here more moderately cautious user might use unix workstation where other people have access but increase security keeping private keys and the executable floppy disk some people will keep multi user system but when dialing over insecure line they will download the message their own system and perform the decryption there however the security provided such mechanism somewhat illusory since you presumably type your cleartext password log you have just given away the store since the attacker can now log you and install traps your account steal your private key next time you use from less insecure line this will likely remain the situation long most systems use the rather quaint mechanism cleartext password authentication find nice put brief statement how carefully manage security arrangement plan next public key that potential correspondents can aware what level precautions are place some people use two keys short one which not carefully managed for ordinary use and longer one which treated with greater care for critical correspondence untrusted partner attacks encryption will ensure that only person with the private key corresponding the public key used encrypt the data may read the traffic however once someone with that key gets the message she may always make whatever kind she wishes there exist cryptographic barriers recipient say taking encrypted message and converting mic only message signed you and readable anyone although does not provide this functionality indeed the latest pem draft have seen specifically states that

during the vertical rise phase the launch pad attitude commanded until loaded sufficient assure launch tower clearance achieved then the tilt maneuver orients the vehicle heads down attitude required generate negative alpha which turn alleviates structural loading other advantages with this attitude are performance gain decreased abort maneuver complexity improved band look angles and crew view the horizon the tilt maneuver also required start gaining downrange velocity achieve the main engine cutoff target second stage this really good answer but couched nasa jargon will try interpret wait until the clears the tower before rolling then roll the around that the angle attack between the wind caused passage through the atmosphere and the chord the wings slightly negative angle this causes little bit downward force and this force alleviates structural loading have careful about those wings they are about the most delicate part the vehicle the new attitude also allows carry more mass orbit achieve higher orbit with the same mass change the orbit higher lower inclination than would the case did not roll the new attitude allows the crew fly less complicated flight path they had execute one the more dangerous abort maneuvers the return launch site the new attitude improves the ability for ground based radio antennae have good line sight signal with the band radio antennae the orbiter the new attitude allows the crew see the horizon which helpful part piloting any flying machine the new attitude orients the that the body more nearly parallel with the ground and the nose the east this allows the thrust from the engines add velocity the correct direction eventually achieve orbit velocity vector quantity made both speed and direction the has have large horizontal component its velocity and very small vertical component attain orbit this all begs the question why not the launch pad oriented give this nice attitude begin with why does the need roll achieve that attitude the answer that the pads were leftovers from the apollo days the straddles two flame trenches one for the solid rocket motor exhaust one for the main engine exhaust the access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented basically the same way they were for the saturn checked with buddy added that the roll maneuver really maneuver all three roll pitch and yaw the roll component that maneuver performed for the reasons stated the pitch component controls loading the wings keeping the angle attack within tight tolerance the yaw component used determine the orbital inclination

cents month police the proposed wiretap chip must raise phone costs less than one part three thousand cost effective bckground until now phones have happened allow the existence wiretaps detectors which could pick conversations phone line over time law enforcement agencies have come rely this capability aid criminal investigations however powerful new encryption technologies threaten this status quo making possible truly private communication small chip each phone could soon make literally impossible overhear conversation without physical microphones either end order preserve the ability law enforcement agencies tap phone conversations the government announced pril that had developed and begun manufacturing special wiretap chip placed future phones instead the total privacy chips which have been under private development the same day announced would use these chips all its secure telephone products each chip would created under government supervision when would given fixed indentifier and encryption key periodically during each conversation the chip would broadcast its identifier and other info special law enforcement block law enforcement officers with court order could then obtain the key corresponding the indentifier from special trust agencies and could thereby listen any future previously recorded conversations that phone date most concerns voiced about this plan have been about its security the government will not disclose the encryption algorithm and many suspect the government will not limit its access the way has claimed the track record previous governments does not inspire confidence this point however this paper will neglect these concerns and ask instead whether this new wiretap chip cost effective tool for police investigation that which cheaper way for society investigate force phone communications support wiretaps give police agencies more money investigate crimes other ways put another way would police agencies willing pay for each wiretap they had pay their share the full social cost forcing phones support wiretaps start answer this question might compare the current benefits wiretaps provide law enforcement agencies with projected costs implementing the new wiretap chip plan since current benefits are easier estimate begin there wiretp benefits the latest year for which wiretap statistics are available that year wiretap installations were requested and requests were denied arrests resulted from wiretaps started the same year arrests came from wiretaps previous years and arrests led convictions the wiretaps were for phones were regarding drug offenses and were requested federal authorities each wiretap installation heard average calls them incriminating among people and cost average mostly for labor thus total about was spent wiretaps obtain about arrests per arrest thus these arrests are least four times more expensive than the per arrest figure one gets dividing the billion spent all police nationally the total non traffic arrests thus the per year spent phone taps only one thousanth the total police expenditures divide this the phone access lines the country get about cents spent per year per phone line about two cents month general deter given class criminals through combination perceived probability being caught and convicted and some expected punishment level convicted the social value having wiretaps more than the amount that would have pay get the same criminal deterrence through other means unable wiretap particular suspect phone police might instead use hidden microphones investigate that suspect other ways police might focus suspects more easily investigated without wiretaps might raise the fine prison time for certain types crime generously assume that these substitutes for wiretaps would average twice expensive wiretaps then the annual social benefit phone wiretaps about equal the current spending level two cents month per phone line wiretp costs let for the moment optimistically assume that the government encryption scheme secure whatever private enterprise would have offered instead protecting our conversations from the spying ears neighbors corporations and governments both foreign and domestic even the need support wiretaps would add many additional costs build and maintain our communication system extra law enforcement blocks would added phone transmissions increasing traffic some unknown percentage special process must used add encryption keys chips while securely distributing these keys special agencies which must funded and monitored the chips themselves are designed military contractor whose design remain secret and are manufactured through special process that the chip becomes nearly impossible take apart private encryption systems not supporting wiretaps would require none these extra costs perhaps most important government degree would least partially replace private marketplace evolution standards for how voice represented encrypted and exchanged our future phones widely believed that governments are less efficient than private enterprise procuring products and standards though they may perhaps perform useful brokering role when choose between competing private standards how much less efficient matter debate some say they pay twice much while others might say only more currently total billion spent operating expenses phone companies which comes out about per month per access line compare this the wiretap value two cents per month see that wiretaps raise average operating costs even much one part then wiretaps are not cost effective this does not even include extra costs phone owners pay because their encryption chips are more expensive course most phones would not have encryption chips for while but the wiretap benefit per phone still the same this argument still applies conclusion given this dramatic difference between the total cost running the phone system and the value wiretaps can justify only the slightest modification the phone system accommodate wiretaps when the only modification required was allow investigators attach clips phone wires wiretap support may have been reasonable but when consider substantial modification the burden proof clearly those proposing such modification show that the costs would really less than the benefits consensus cannot obtain this

purpose than defend the idea infant baptism even among its supporters however people will stop short saying that unbaptised infants will hell very easy for just about anyone come with partial list scripture support any sort wrong doctrine however have the heart persevere our beliefs make sure that they are biblically based then can come understanding the truth let now take more complete look scripture colossians him you were also circumcised the putting off the sinful nature not with circumcision done having been buried with him baptism and raised with him through your faith the power who raised him from the dead baptism are raised new life through personal faith the power our parent faith cannot this infants have faith let look what the bible has say about romans but not all the israelites accepted the good news for says lord who has believed our message consequently faith comes from hearing the message and the message heard through the word then receive gift faith hear the message the gospel possible response hearing word preached kids are not yet spiritually intellectually emotionally mature enough respond word hence they cannot have faith and therefore cannot raised baptism new life ezekiel the soul who sins will die the son will not share the guilt the father nor will the father share the guilt the son the righteousness the righteous man will credited him and the wickedness the wicked will charged against him you read all ezekiel you will see that does not hold guilty for anyone else sins can have original guilt from ezekiel rid yourselves all the offenses you have committted and get new heart and new spirit why will you die house israel for take pleasure the death anyone declares the sovereign lord repent and live the way please repent and get new heart and spirit kids cannot this acts says that when repent and are baptized will then receive new spirit the holy spirit then shall live now then that have little more background why original sin not let look some the scriptures used support romans therefore just sin entered the world through one man and death through sin and this way death came all men because all sinned and death entered the world when the first man sinned came each man because each man sinned note that good read through all romans some the verses are easier misunderstand than others but read them context will see that they are all saying basically the same thing let look one such romans for just through the disobedience the one man the many were made sinners also through the obedience the one man the many will made righteous through the disobedience each individual each was made sinner the same way through the obedience each will made righteous must remember when reading through this passage that death came each man only because each man sinned not because guilt from otherwise the bible would contradict itself encourage you read through this whole passage your own looking from this point view see does not all fit together psalm surely was sinful birth sinful from the time mother conceived this whole psalm wonderful example how should humble ourselves before repentance for sinning himself was man after own heart and wrote the psalm after committing adultry with and murdering her husband all that saying here that can not remember time when was not sinful humbling himself before confessing his sinfulness his saying that was sinful birth hyperbole the bible being inspired not limited literal interpetation but also uses figures speech did for another example hyperbole see luke now then even though people see that baptism requires faith and that original sin not they will still argue that infant baptism necessary because children sin being selfish not sharing toys with other children being mean hitting others and fighting etc certainly have observed children doing wrong things but gut feeling always that they not know any better let look see the bible agrees with gut feelings therefore the lord himself will give you the virgin will with child and will give birth son and will call him immanuel will eat curds and honey when knows enough reject the wrong and choose the right now just about any church leader will tell you that this prophecy about they not then point them matthew and find new leader certainly could not have had less knowledge than normal human babies yet this passage says that had mature certain extent before would know the difference between right and wrong see that did grow and become wiser luke and the implication that did wrong things child before knew choose right over wrong know that was perfect without sin have rather conclusive proof that babies cannot sin because they not know choose the right instead the wrong himself was baptized albeit with baptism not infant but thirty year old man and started his ministry soon was baptized immediately afterwards was tempted the devil thank you for your attention moderator this should finish the subject for while

traditions second saying that has other purpose than defending infant baptism hominem argument which has considerable evidence against the original baptist theology included original sin and some baptists still hold and there are certainly groups that baptize infants without believing original sin among protestants the sacraments tend bit more symbolic than among catholics protestants who baptize infants see baptism sign acceptance rather than our acceptance traditional protestant theology grace precedes our response and applicable children there are number passages one can cite

name did not ask for hence the term name calling what you expect tell you tell you wsidom you insist giving names titles did not ask for you could least spell them correctly sigh that was only confuse you hell bent retarding into childhood when you are intentionally neglecting the most important fact that the whole israeli presence the occupied territories illegitimate and hence all their actions their courts their laws are illegitimate the ground occupied territories not neglecting that merely asking you whether the existance israeli citicens the gaza invalidates those individuals right are you trying retaliate and confuse here really try spell correctly and apologize did confuse you will try not repeat that live human right can get back the question which law should used the territories later also you have not adressed question the israelis also have human rights first above statement doesnot say that the existence israeli citizens the revoke their right life but says the israeli occupation the revoke the right life for some most its citizens basically revokes the right for its military men clearly occupation undeclared war during war attacks against military targets are fully legitimate let phrase the question have repeatedly asked you the israelis have less human rights than the palestinians and why from your posting inferred that you thought together with the above statement then assumed that the reason was the actions the state israel your statement would like you define the term not have repeat this wouldrag the answer out hasan procedure more than neccesary secondly surely israeli have human rights but they ask their goverment protect withdrawing from the occupied terretories not further oppressing palestinean human rights sorry but the above sentence does not make sense please rephrase state can deprive all citizens human rights its actions then tell why any human living today should have any rights all because not all states are like israel oppressive ignorant tyrant how about the human rights the syrians iraqis and others does the name hama sound familiar how about the kurds iraq and turkey how about the same sweden the russians the baltic states the moslem the old ussr and yugoslavia the serbs have any human rights remainaing according you and which system you propose use solve the problem the question not which system would solve the problem why because any system can solve the laws minister says kick palestineans out here asked for which system should used that will preserve human rights for all people involved assumed that was obvious but will not repeat that mistake now that have straightened that out eagerly awaiting your reply you agree that that israeli solution wouldnot preserve human rights agreeing that just kick all the palestinians out israel proper would probably lead disaster for both parties that what you refer the israeli solution then said best when writing his diary between ourselves must clear that there room for both peoples together this country shall not achieve our goal being independent people with the this small country the only solution palestine least western palestine without and there other way than transfer the from here the neighbouring countries transfer all them not one village not one tribe should left only after this transfer will the country able absorb the millions our own brethren there other way out davar september just are disregard the rather obvious references getting israel out one way the other both plo covenant and hamas charter why should give any credence private paper even older not going get into the question wrote the above but fairly obvious all parties the conflict have their share fanatics what those are not the people that will make any lasting peace the region more deleted stuff exactly you are right guess that the problem that the israeli goverment full with men like have you met with them personally read their diaries fascinating what you for living and our either refers jews well can give you answer you wisdom will not suggest the imperialist israeli system for solving the problem think that fair enough that not answer since asked for system that could solve the problem you said any could used then you provided contradiction above you wrote that you understood what meant any system can used solve the conflict but not any system would resolve justly unjust solution would non solution per definition you said the for all holds that have property there exists such that property does not hold thus either both statements must false where that takes your logic never never land you are proving yourself first you understood what meant but then you claim you didnot claim contradiction logic bad for you the wisdom was merely pointing out not small flaw your reasoning since you claim logical felt best point this out before you started using your statements prove point then assume you are not logical the greatest problem children and the way let add that these cute quotes you put the end are real bummer when try giving your posts any credit why you feel ashamed things and facts that you believe you were you believe codes and acts well feel sorry for you because the same had said yes racism you feel ashamed and bothered the codes then drop you are not why are you bothered then you should join condemning

discourse there has been much discussion recently about the right freedom association and appear take absolutist position this right that fundamental human right perhaps the fundamental human right and that supersedes other rights such the right equal opportunity others feel that right equal opportunity outweighs the right freedom association and thus have the never ending debate that flares repeatedly association involves the mutual and voluntary agreement two more people right involves coercion all cases major problem that neither these rights are explicitly declared protected the constitution the declaration independence although both can derived from these documents unfortunately this means that the debate will never end because neither side can conclu sively prove the validity their view becomes solely matter personal philosophy yes there much debate but can end with once and for all recognition these rights personal opinion that the real answer lies somewhere between regard both these rights fundamental human rights which unfortu nately come into direct conflict with one another stronger depends the given situation there even more discusion about religion should take somewhere between approach towards the state state recognized religion the first amendment absolutist you know for example the owner mom and pop store wishes hire employee help out their right freedom association outweighs the rights their job applicants equal opportunity they should free hire whomever they choose using whatever criteria they choose without any government intervention all similarly family wishes rent out bedroom their home garage apartment something similar then their right freedom association outweighs the rights their prospective tenants equal opportunity the other hand ibm multi national corporation with employees publicly owned and operated board directors wishes hire additional employees then whose freedom association are protecting the board directors the other employees the owners the stock this case the applicant right equal opportunity outweighs the right freedom association and society can ask ibm use only those criteria which are relevant the specific task why says who why can mon pop have foa but ibm forced and force the correct word here have reo purchase ibm voluntary then there are very well defined procedures how ibm chooses some things and chooses other things why not let those same procedures work for employment policies similarly landlord owns number apartment buildings which does not live and which are managed independent management agency then whose freedom association are protecting the owner does not live his buildings and has contact with his tenants then the prospective tenant right equal opportunity outweighs the right freedom association and society can ask the owner use only those criteria which are relevant good tenants why does this tenant have option destroy the foa the landlord the landlord and the tenant can not agree then they both can cease from using each other property suddenly arm waving magic landlord does not have foa and what basis does the foa the landlord disappear seems that vague terms like contact with tenants suffice well think foa one our most important rightts and golly the state going make suffer sure would like see the heinous crime that justifies the removal this right not think contact with the tenats even crime much less something that should cause severe interference with important rights suspect that the majority the people this country agree with position these extreme cases particularly they are presented this manner not know would agree suspect not any case additional problems arise when try apply guidelines for the middle ground what the company has employees where draw the line between protecting the right freedom association and protecting the right equal opportunity rights are not defined majority mob choice foa absolute reo fancy name for thuggery for racism and coercion the difficulty that any line draw will necessity artificial and any legislation resulting will flawed the past the government has usually tried pass laws which referred the number employees hired the company any company with more than xxx employees was affected the law those with fewer were unaffected course would you dimly see that the line must artifiacial because foa the only right just like state religion you can not jsutify that either generally believe that not have any regulations affecting these rights then the right freedom association will stronger the other hand many the regulations protect the right equal opportunity too much weakening the right freedom association not believe there satisfactory solution which will please everybody solution that came with use publicly owned privately owned the dividing line the company remains privately owned then the owners should free whatever they want with their company the company becomes publicly owned then the public has right ask the company submit additional regulation why assume that when you say publicly owned you are talking about those quasi state companys that not have shareholders the companies the fortune for example are all privately owned they can give you list all their owners they have anonymous unknown them owners the way the above analysis based the assumption that the right freedom association and the right equal opportunity are both fundamental human rights equal importance since this entirely matter faith not subject any proof not choose even

comments can only charactrized irrelevant and heavily colored the preconceptions and misinformation will try paint the most accurate picture can what the situation really south_lebanon article there any civilian your opinion now not condone myself bombing villages any kind villages but you claim these are villages with civilians and iraelis claim they are camps filled with terrorists you claim that israelis shell the villages with the hope finding terrorist they kill one fine not too bad civilians die right not sure was back home village this last summer for your information are people not bunch indiscriminate terrorists most the people village are regular inhabitants that about their daily business some work the fields some own small shops others are older men that the coffe shop and drink coffee that hard imagine not terrorist camp you and the like view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer the streets women preparing lunch men playing cards etc some young men usually aged between years are members the lebanese resistance even the inhabitants the village not know who these are they are secretive about but most people often suspect who they are and what they are these young men are supported financially iran most the time they sneak arms and ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set booby traps for patrols every time soldier killed injured these traps retalliates bombing villages their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians once they are back they announce that they bombed terrorist hideout where year old girl just happened are now accustomed tactics and figure that this the way telling that you are gonna hurt our soldiers you are gonna pay the price accept this price have pay free our land knows very well that not really hurting the resistance that much militarily with these strikes but rather just keeping the pressure the villagers demand from their young men stop attacking soldiers since these attacks are taking heavy toll the lives the civilian villagers retalliation policy cold hearted but reality that have come accept and deal with the lebanese resistance the other hand not going stop its attacks occupying israeli soldiers until they withdraw this the only real leverage that they have force withdraw the people south_lebanon are occupied shelled regular basis not want occupied insists that the called security zone necessary for the protection than will have pay the price its occupation with the blood its soldiers interested peace than should withdraw from our land are not asking for the establishment lebanese occupied zone northern protect our villages that are attacked regular basis the best policy seems the removal occupation and the establishment peace keeping troops along the border have written before this very newsgroup that the only real solution will come result comprehensive peace settlement whereby withdraws its own borders and peace keeping troops are stationed along the border insure one either side the border shelled this the only realistic solution time for realize that the concept buffer zone aimed protecting its northern cities has failed fact has caused much more deaths than the occasional shelling would have resulted really wants save some lives would withdraw unilaterally from the called security zone before the conclusion the peace talks such move would save lives advance peace efforts give great moral lift better public image abroad and give edge the peace negociations since can rightly claim that genuinely interested peace and has already offered some important concessions along with such withdrawal could demand that disarmed the lebanese government and warn that will not accept any attacks against its northern cities and that such shelling occurs than will consider taking the buffer zone and will hold the lebanese and syrian government responsible for there seems very little incentive for the syrian and lebanese
